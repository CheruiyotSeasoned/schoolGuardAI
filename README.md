# üéì SchoolGuard AI

> A real-time, multi-tenant backend engine for school surveillance, built for developers, AI teams, and edtech founders.

---

## üîê Built by [Brian Cheruiyot](https://github.com/your-profile)

SchoolGuard AI is the backend system that powers real-time surveillance in smart schools ‚Äî detecting fights, sneaking, bullying, phone use, and more ‚Äî and triggering alerts across dashboards, SMS, and email.

It‚Äôs built to be modular, deployable, and powerful ‚Äî and it also powers enterprise systems like Akilinova AIOTA.

## üß± Architecture Overview

| Service          | Tech Stack               | Role                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| **Auth Service** | Spring Boot + MySQL      | Multi-tenant auth + roles     |
| **ML API**       | FastAPI (Python)         | Receives YOLO/OpenCV events   |
| **Processor**    | NestJS + Kafka + MongoDB | Processes events in real time |
| **Alert Engine** | Node.js / Python worker  | Sends notifications           |
| **Dashboard**    | React or Vue (planned)   | View logs + manage users      |

## üß† Overview

**Project:** SchoolGuard AI
**Author:** Brian Cheruiyot
**Purpose:** Provide a multi-tenant, real-time backend for AI-based school surveillance systems that integrates ML event detection, alerting, and role-based access for schools of all sizes.

This system is designed to power larger platforms like **Akilinova AIOTA**, while also standing alone as a plug-and-play backend solution.

## üß± Architecture Breakdown

### üîπ 1. System Stack & Microservices

| Service          | Tech Stack                      | Purpose                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Auth Service     | Spring Boot + MySQL             | Manages users, roles, school tenants    |
| ML API           | FastAPI + Python                | Receives ML detections (YOLO, OpenCV)   |
| Event Processor  | NestJS + Kafka + MongoDB        | Processes events in real-time           |
| Alert Dispatcher | Node.js / Python / Kafka Worker | Sends out SMS, email alerts, webhooks   |
| School Dashboard | React / Vue (planned)           | View logs, stream alerts, manage access |

---

### üîπ 2. Multi-Tenancy Strategy

* Each school is a **tenant** with a unique `tenant_id`
* Role-based users belong to tenants: admins, teachers, security
* All services support tenant isolation:

  * Kafka messages include `tenant_id`
  * MongoDB collections are indexed by tenant
  * Auth token encodes tenant scope

### üîπ 3. Event Flow Architecture

```
Camera Feed (RTSP)
   ‚¨á
ML Model (YOLO/OpenCV)
   ‚¨á
FastAPI Event Poster (/event)
   ‚¨á
Kafka Producer ‚ûú Topic: ml_events
   ‚¨á
NestJS Kafka Consumer
   ‚¨á
MongoDB (tenant-aware)
   ‚¨á
Notification Engine ‚ûú SMS, Email, Dashboard
```

### üîπ 4. Deployment Roadmap

#### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Edge Setup (Per School)

* Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano with YOLO
* Connects to RTSP/DVR feed
* Sends ML events to central FastAPI

#### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Core Backend Services

* Kafka broker cluster
* FastAPI event poster
* NestJS + MongoDB consumer
* Spring Boot for roles + tokens

#### ‚úÖ Phase 3: Notification & Monitoring

* Alert workers for SMS/email/Telegram
* Role-based access dashboards
* Logging, audit trails per school

#### ‚úÖ Phase 4: Scale & Region Support

* Region-based multi-tenant partitions
* Docker Swarm / K8s deployment
* SSO/LDAP school-wide integrations (planned)
