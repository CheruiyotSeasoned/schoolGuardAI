# 🎓 SchoolGuard AI

> A real-time, multi-tenant backend engine for school surveillance, built for developers, AI teams, and edtech founders.

---

## 🔐 Built by [Brian Cheruiyot](https://github.com/your-profile)

SchoolGuard AI is the backend system that powers real-time surveillance in smart schools — detecting fights, sneaking, bullying, phone use, and more — and triggering alerts across dashboards, SMS, and email.

It’s built to be modular, deployable, and powerful — and it also powers enterprise systems like Akilinova AIOTA.

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

| Service            | Tech Stack                     | Role                         |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Auth Service**   | Spring Boot + MySQL             | Multi-tenant auth + roles     |
| **ML API**         | FastAPI (Python)                | Receives YOLO/OpenCV events   |
| **Processor**      | NestJS + Kafka + MongoDB        | Processes events in real time |
| **Alert Engine**   | Node.js / Python worker         | Sends notifications           |
| **Dashboard**      | React or Vue (planned)          | View logs + manage users      |
